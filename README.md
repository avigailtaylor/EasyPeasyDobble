# EasyPeasyDobble

Generating Dobble card sets the easy way... Using the concept of cyclic difference sets as the mathematical basis for the algorithm rather than finite projective planes. :)

## Also, Frobble!
Frobble is a new kind of double-sided Dobble... A set of pictures on one side of the card, and six matching French vocab words on the other... Take two cards, one card picture-side up, one card vocab-side up, find the single match and shout out the French word... Voila! You're learning French!
